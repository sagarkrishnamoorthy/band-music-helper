# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, socioeconomic status, or technical ability.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Acknowledging and respecting the contributions of others
- Being patient with questions and helping others learn

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Bullying or intimidation
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors
- Any conduct that violates laws or promotes discrimination

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor whose behavior is inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the project contact email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
